# ShoobFlix-MERN
This is a clone version of Netflix Website using MERN Stack and Tailwind CSS. 

Features:
- Users can search from movies or tv shows from anywhere in the website via the search bar in the Navbar
- In this clone project, users can view the trailers of said movie or tv show they want to search for
- Users can add the movies and tv shows they love the most to their favourites and also delete them or view them later by visiting the Favourites Page.
- To mimic the concept of seasons in the Watch Page the trailers will appear randomly each time user refreshes inside different Seasons(minimum: 3 and minimum 1 in each Season)
- There is a working Profile Edit Page where the User can use a different avatar and change their usernames. They cant change password and email for now.
- There are carousel for the different categories which has a simple working version of infinite scrolling(very primitive implementation).
- On signup you will get option to select an avatar or you can skip to select it later from the avatar icon in the top right.
- This uses TMDB Api to fetch movie/tv show details.
- Uses MERN Stack and Tailwind CSS for quick and easy styling.
